The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a common programming model in high
performance computing (HPC). The parallel nature and large scale of MPI
programs makes them a valuable target for program verification. Existing tools
approach the problem by verifying a small subset of the MPI specification.
Specifically, previous static analyses only addressed point-to-point
communication without tags. This paper presents an extension to an existing
SMT-based approach that adds support for tagged messages and multiple
communicators. We then show how to leverage this extension to verify programs
that use MPI collective communication. The paper also presents an efficient
algorithm that approximates the input match pairs using simple counting for two
types of message non-determinism. The experimental results demonstrate that the
new SMT encoding is capable of precisely reasoning about the behavior in a set
of benchmarks.
