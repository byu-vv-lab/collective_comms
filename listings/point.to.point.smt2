;The above rule will need to change for tags, but we believe it is OK for the point-to-point we currently support. The issue with tags relates to the separate run-time buffers for each destination. Different tags go to different buffers on the destination, so that effectively makes it appear that sends are reordered, even around waits (assuming those waits are send waits). This also assumes that we have send-waits (currently we do not). We will need those for send-modes. Bottom line: the rule is fine for the base point-to-point encoding where we only wait on receives and there are not tags.  It must change for send-modes and tags.
